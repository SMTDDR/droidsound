
==== Droudsound ====

RUNNING

For now, put your Music under /sdcard/MODS/

C64Music.zip will be scanned and indexed if present.


BUILDING

Droidsound should now build with the normal Android NDK r4 (and above hopefully)

Just run ndk-build from the droidsound directory to build the sound plugins, then build the project
as you normally would (By importing it into eclipse for instance).
