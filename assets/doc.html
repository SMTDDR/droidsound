<h1>Droidsound Help</h1>

<h2>The User Interface</h2>

Droidsound lets you switch between 3 main screens using the button in the top-right corner;

<h3>The Browser</h3>
<p>
This lets you browse through your music collection.</p>
<p>
Tapping a directory, archive or play list will enter it.<br/>
Tapping a song will play it.<br/>
Press <tt>BACK</tt> to go back up one level.<br/>
Long press <tt>BACK</tt> to go up to the top level.<br/>
Long press a song for more options.<br/>
</p>
<h3>The Info Screen</h3>

<p>
This screen shows information about the current song, and lets
you control playback.</p>
<p>
Tapping the <tt>Forward</tt> / <tt>Back</tt> buttons will switch sub tunes. If there are
no subtunes, it will switch song.<br/>
Long pressing <tt>Forward</tt> / <tt>Back</tt> will always go to the next / previous song.<br>Pause and stop should be self-explanatory<br/>
Tap the <tt>Plus</tt>-sign to add the current song to the active playlist.<br/>
Tap <tt>SEQ</tt> / <tt>RND</tt> to switch between sequential and random order playback.<br/>
Tap <tt>CONT</tt> to turn on/off continous playback, meaning the next song will
play automatically when the current is done. <i>Note</i> that changing sub tunes
will turn <tt>CONT</tt> off, to avoid switching song when the user may not want to.
</p>
<h3>The Search Screen</h3>

This screen shows the latest search results, and also provides a button
for searching (besides the one in the main menu). The search screen works
similar to the Browser.

<h3>Handling Playlists</h3>
<p>
You can add songs to playlists. There is always an <i>active</i> playlist, starting
with the Favorites playlist which is created automatically. Long press on
another playlist and choose &quot;Set as current&quot; to change the active playlist.
</p>
You can add songs, directories and even other playlists to the active playlist.
<p>
To add specific (or even all) sub tunes of a song, you need to start playing that
song, and then tap the <tt>Plus</tt> sign on the Info screen.
</p>

<h3>Databases</h3>
<p>
Droidsound provides access for &quot;external&quot; databases. Currently only <i>CSDb</i> is available.
When you enter a database Search will search that database instead of your normal music
collection.
</p>
<h3>Headset &amp; Media Buttons</h3>
<p>
You can control Droidsound with the Media button on your headset;
</p>
<p>
Single tap to play/pause.<br/>
Squeeze ( > 0.5s) to change song.<br/>
Hold for more than 3s to turn speech on/off.<br/>
</p>
<p><i>Note</i> that the button will not be activate unless the player is playing or paused.</p>

<h2>The Song Database</h2>

<p>Droidsound uses a database both for browsing and searching files, so it needs to
keep the files on storage in sync with it's database. It does this by scanning for
changes each time you start Droidsound (you can also do an explicit scan from the
Settings menu).</p>
<p>When changes are detected (an file that has been added, removed or changed) Droidsound
locks the database and opens a dialog showing progress. This should only happen when 
there are actual changes, if you see the dialog each time it probably means
you have files that are not detected as songs somewhere in your <tt>MODS</tt>-direcotry.
</p>
